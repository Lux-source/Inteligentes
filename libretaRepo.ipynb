    "#### Important Considerations About the Search Class\n",
    " - **Use of Node Counter**: In both `a_star_search` and `best_first_search`, a node counter (`Node.node_counter`) is used when pushing nodes onto the priority queue. This ensures that all items in the queue have a unique secondary key, preventing comparison errors when nodes have equal priority values.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Explanation of Counter Usage**: The counter is used to avoid redefining comparison methods (`__lt__`, `__gt__`) in the `Node` class. It serves as a tie-breaker in the priority queue when nodes have equal `f_cost` or heuristic cost.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Consistent Frontier Management**: The `explored` set and `frontier_state_costs` dictionary are properly updated to manage nodes efficiently.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Output Formatting**: The `format_solution_details` function displays the action costs with five decimal places, reflecting the travel time in seconds.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Consistent Units**: The `path_cost` and action costs are calculated in seconds, ensuring consistency across the algorithms.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Avoiding Comparison Errors**: By using a unique counter when pushing nodes onto the priority queue, the code avoids `TypeError` exceptions that can occur when the heap tries to compare `Node` objects directly.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Efficient Frontier Handling**: The use of `frontier_state_costs` in `a_star_search` helps avoid revisiting states via more expensive paths"

    "##### Purpose:\n",
    "* Test eacg search algorithm (BFS, DFS, A*, Best-First) using a problem instance loaded from a JSON file. It runs the algorithms, captures their results and statistics, and prints formatted outputs for verification .\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses `loadJSON` from `ImportJSON.py` to parse the JSON file and initialize the `Problem` instance containing states and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Executing Search Algorithms**\n",
    "   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n",
    "     - Instantiates `BreadthFirstSearch` and executes the `search` method.\n",
    "   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:\n",
    "     - Instantiates `DepthFirstSearch` and executes the `search` method.\n",
    "   - **A\\* Search**:\n",
    "     - Instantiates `AStarSearch` with the provided `heuristic` function and executes the `search` method.\n",
    "   - **Best-First Search**:\n",
    "     - Instantiates `BestFirstSearch` with the provided `heuristic` function and executes the `search` method.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **Output Formatting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses `format_solution_details` to neatly format and display the solution paths along with performance statistics such as nodes generated, nodes explored, solution depth, solution cost, and execution time. As well as the action costs with five decimal places, reflecting the travel in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that the `json_file_path` points to a valid JSON file containing the problem instance.\n",
    "- The printed outputs provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of each search algorithm."
