# Inteligentes

Welcome to the **Inteligentes** project! This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms to navigate through a city represented as a graph. Below is the detailed documentation for each file in the project, explaining their purposes, methods, and attributes.
---

### **Action.py**

```python
class Action:
    def __init__(self, origin, destination, distance, speed):
        self.origin = origin  # State object
        self.destination = destination  # State object
        self.distance = distance  # Distance between origin and destination
        self.speed = speed  # Speed limit on this segment

    def cost(self):
        # Calculate travel time as the cost
        return self.distance / self.speed

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Action({self.origin.identifier} -> {self.destination.identifier}, distance={self.distance}, speed={self.speed})"
```

**Purpose**:

- Represents a road segment connecting two intersections (states) in the city. It encapsulates information about the distance and speed limit of the segment.

**Attributes**:

- `origin`: The starting state (intersection) for this action.
- `destination`: The ending state (intersection) for this action.
- `distance`: The distance between `origin` and `destination`.
- `speed`: The speed limit on this segment.

**Methods**:

- `cost(self)`: Calculates and returns the travel time as the cost by dividing `distance` by `speed`.
- `__repr__(self)`: Provides a string representation of the `Action` object for easy debugging and logging.

### **ImportJSON.py**

```python
import json
from State import State
from Action import Action
from Problem import Problem


def loadJSON(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r") as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    intersections = {}
    for i_data in data["intersections"]:
        inter = State(
            identifier=i_data["identifier"],
            latitude=i_data["latitude"],
            longitude=i_data["longitude"],
        )
        intersections[inter.identifier] = inter

    segments = []
    for seg_data in data["segments"]:
        origin = intersections[seg_data["origin"]]
        destination = intersections[seg_data["destination"]]
        segment = Action(
            origin=origin,
            destination=destination,
            distance=seg_data["distance"],
            speed=seg_data["speed"],
        )
        segments.append(segment)
        # Add neighbors to the origin state
        origin.neighbors.append((destination, segment))

    # Pre-sort neighbors for each state to eliminate sorting during search
    for state in intersections.values():
        state.neighbors.sort(key=lambda x: x[0].identifier, reverse=True)

    initial_state = intersections[data["initial"]]
    goal_state = intersections[data["final"]]

    return Problem(initial_state, goal_state, intersections, segments)
```

**Purpose**:

- Loads and parses the JSON file containing information about intersections and road segments. It creates `State` and `Action` objects based on the data and returns a `Problem` instance.

**Function**:

- `loadJSON(file_path)`: Reads the JSON file, initializes `State` and `Action` objects, links intersections with their neighbors, pre-sorts the neighbors for each state, and returns a `Problem` instance containing all necessary information for the search algorithms.

**Key Operations**:

1. **Parsing Intersections**: Creates `State` objects for each intersection and stores them in a dictionary for easy access.
2. **Parsing Segments**: Creates `Action` objects for each road segment, linking origin and destination `State` objects.
3. **Linking Neighbors**: Appends each destination and corresponding action to the `neighbors` list of the origin state.
4. **Pre-sorting Neighbors**: Sorts the `neighbors` list for each state based on the destination identifier in reverse order to maintain consistent traversal order during searches.

### **Node.py**

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, state, parent=None, action=None, path_cost=0):
        self.state = state  # State object
        self.parent = parent  # Parent Node
        self.action = action  # Action taken to reach this node
        self.path_cost = path_cost  # Total cost from the root node to this node
        self.depth = 0 if parent is None else parent.depth + 1

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Node(State={self.state.identifier}, Path cost={self.path_cost}, Depth={self.depth})"
```

**Purpose**:

- Represents a node in the search tree. It contains information about the current state, the action taken to reach it, and the cumulative cost and depth of the node.

**Attributes**:

- `state`: The current state (intersection) this node represents.
- `parent`: The parent node leading to this node.
- `action`: The action taken to reach this node from its parent.
- `path_cost`: The cumulative cost from the root node to this node.
- `depth`: The depth of this node in the search tree.

**Methods**:

- `__repr__(self)`: Provides a string representation of the `Node` object, displaying the state identifier, path cost, and depth for debugging purposes.

**Notes**:

- The `expand` method has been removed/commented out to streamline node creation directly within the search functions.

---

### **Problem.py**

```python
class Problem:
    def __init__(self, initial_state, goal_state, intersections, segments):
        self.initial_state = initial_state  # Starting State
        self.goal_state = goal_state  # Goal State
        self.intersections = intersections  # Dictionary of State objects (key: identifier)
        self.segments = segments  # List of Action objects

    def actions(self, state):
        """Returns the actions available from a given state."""
        return state.neighbors

    def result(self, state, action):
        """Returns the resulting state after taking an action."""
        return action.destination

    def goal_test(self, state):
        """Checks if the given state is the goal state."""
        return state == self.goal_state

    def path_cost(self, cost_so_far, state1, action, state2):
        """Returns the cost of a solution path that arrives at state2 from state1."""
        return cost_so_far + action.cost()
```

**Purpose**:

- Represents the problem of navigating the city by defining the initial state, goal state, and methods to interact with states and actions.

**Attributes**:

- `initial_state`: The starting state for the search.
- `goal_state`: The target state that the search aims to reach.
- `intersections`: Dictionary of all `State` objects, keyed by their identifier.
- `segments`: List of all `Action` objects (road segments).

**Methods**:

- `actions(self, state)`: Returns all available actions (segments) from the given state.
- `result(self, state, action)`: Returns the state resulting from taking an action.
- `goal_test(self, state)`: Checks if a state is the goal state.
- `path_cost(self, cost_so_far, state1, action, state2)`: Computes the cumulative cost of a path.

```

**Purpose**:

- Implements various search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A\*, Best-First) to navigate through the city graph. It also includes helper functions for solution path reconstruction and output formatting.

**Functions and Classes**:

1. **Helper Functions**:

   - `solution(node)`: Reconstructs the solution path by traversing from the goal node back to the initial node.
   - `format_solution_details(solution_path, stats)`: Formats the solution path and performance statistics for easy readability.
   - `format_time(seconds)`: Converts elapsed time in seconds to a `days:hours:min:seconds` format.

2. **Search Algorithms**:

   - `breadth_first_search(problem)`: Implements the BFS algorithm using a queue (`deque`). It tracks nodes generated and explored, and returns the solution path and statistics upon finding the goal.
   - `depth_first_search(problem)`: Implements the DFS algorithm using a stack (list). It uses a `frontier_states` set for efficient duplicate checks and returns the solution path and statistics upon finding the goal.
   - `a_star_search(problem, heuristic)`: Implements the A\* search algorithm using a priority queue (`heapq`). It utilizes a heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal efficiently.
   - `best_first_search(problem, heuristic)`: Implements the Best-First Search algorithm using a priority queue, guided solely by the heuristic function.

3. **Heuristic Function**:

   - `heuristic(state, goal_state)`: Calculates the Euclidean distance between the current state and the goal state as the heuristic.

4. **Abstract Base Class**:

   - `SearchAlgorithm(ABC)`: Defines an abstract base class for all search algorithms, ensuring consistency in their implementation.

5. **Search Algorithm Classes**:
   - `BreadthFirstSearch`, `DepthFirstSearch`, `AStarSearch`, `BestFirstSearch`: Concrete classes inheriting from `SearchAlgorithm`, each implementing their respective search strategies.

**Key Optimizations**:

- **Pre-sorted Neighbors**: Neighbors are sorted during problem initialization in `ImportJSON.py` to eliminate the need for sorting during each node expansion, enhancing performance.
- **Efficient Explored Set Management**: In DFS, a separate `frontier_states` set is maintained for **O(1)** duplicate checks, reducing computational overhead.
- **Lightweight Node Creation**: Nodes are created efficiently without unnecessary methods or attributes, ensuring faster node expansions.

### **State.py**

```python
class State:
    def __init__(self, identifier, latitude, longitude):
        self.identifier = identifier
        self.latitude = latitude
        self.longitude = longitude
        self.neighbors = []  # List of (neighbor_state, action/segment) tuples

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return isinstance(other, State) and self.identifier == other.identifier

    def __hash__(self):
        # Hash method to allow using State instances in sets or as dictionary keys
        return hash(self.identifier)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"State({self.identifier}, {self.latitude}, {self.longitude})"
```

**Purpose**:

- Represents an intersection (state) in the city graph, storing its unique identifier, geographical coordinates, and connected neighbors.

**Attributes**:

- `identifier`: Unique identifier of the state (e.g., intersection name or number).
- `latitude`, `longitude`: Geographical coordinates of the intersection.
- `neighbors`: List of tuples containing neighboring `State` objects and the corresponding `Action` objects (road segments).

**Methods**:

- `__eq__(self, other)`: Determines equality based on the state's identifier.
- `__hash__(self)`: Enables `State` objects to be used in sets and as dictionary keys by returning a hash of the identifier.
- `__repr__(self)`: Provides a string representation of the `State` object for debugging purposes.

**Notes**:

- Ensures immutability post-creation to maintain consistent hashing and equality checks.
- Neighbors are pre-sorted during initialization for efficient traversal during searches.

### **Testing.py**

```python
from ImportJSON import loadJSON
from Search import (
    BreadthFirstSearch,
    DepthFirstSearch,
    AStarSearch,
    BestFirstSearch,
    heuristic,
    format_solution_details,
)

if best_first_result:
    output = format_solution_details(best_first_result, best_first_stats)
    print(output)
else:
    print("No solution found")
```

**Purpose**:

- Tests each search algorithm (BFS, DFS, A\*, Best-First) using a problem instance loaded from a JSON file. It runs the algorithms, captures their results and statistics, and prints formatted outputs for verification.

**Key Operations**:

1. **Loading the Problem**:

   - Utilizes `loadJSON` from `ImportJSON.py` to parse the JSON file and initialize the `Problem` instance containing states and actions.

2. **Executing Search Algorithms**:

   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
     - Instantiates `BreadthFirstSearch` and executes the `search` method.
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
     - Instantiates `DepthFirstSearch` and executes the `search` method.
   - **A\* Search**:
     - Instantiates `AStarSearch` with the provided `heuristic` function and executes the `search` method.
   - **Best-First Search**:
